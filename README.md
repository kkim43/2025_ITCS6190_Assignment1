Got it üëç ‚Äîhere‚Äôs a clean, simple **README.md template** tailored to your assignment. You can copy this into your repo‚Äôs root and adjust minor details if needed.

# üöÄ Assignment #1: Docker Containers

This project demonstrates a simple **two-container Docker stack**:

* A **PostgreSQL database** seeded with trip data.
* A **Python application** that queries the database, computes statistics, and writes results to a JSON file.

It shows how to use Docker Compose for multi-container setups, environment variables, service networking, and reproducible workflows.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (usually included with Docker)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

From the project root:

```bash
# Build and run everything
make all

# Or just start stack (attached logs)
make up

# Run in background (if you added `up-detach`)
# make up-detach

# Stop and clean containers + volumes
make down
```

---

## üìÇ Outputs

* Results are written to:

  ```
  out/summary.json
  ```
* The same summary is printed to stdout during execution.

---

## üìù Example Output

**Terminal (stdout):**

```json
=== Summary ===
{
  "total_trips": 6,
  "avg_fare_by_city": [
    {"city": "Charlotte", "avg_fare": 16.25},
    {"city": "New York", "avg_fare": 19.0},
    {"city": "San Francisco", "avg_fare": 20.25}
  ],
  "top_by_minutes": [
    {"city": "San Francisco", "minutes": 28, "fare": 29.3},
    {"city": "New York", "minutes": 26, "fare": 27.1},
    {"city": "Charlotte", "minutes": 21, "fare": 20.0}
  ]
}
```

**File (`out/summary.json`):**

```json
{
  "total_trips": 6,
  "avg_fare_by_city": [...],
  "top_by_minutes": [...]
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

* **DB not ready**: If the app says ‚ÄúWaiting for database‚Ä¶‚Äù, it‚Äôs normal‚ÄîCompose waits until Postgres passes its healthcheck.
* **Password errors**: Ensure `DB_PASS` in `compose.yml` matches `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
* **Reset everything** (fresh DB, clean output):

  ```bash
  make clean
  make up
  ```
* **Permission issues on `/out`**: Ensure the `out/` folder is writable on your host:

  ```bash
  chmod 777 out
  ```

---

## üìö Notes

* Press `Ctrl+C` to stop `make up` (attached mode).
* Use `make down` to remove containers and reset DB volumes.
* This project is part of *Cloud Computing for Data Analysis (ITCS 6190/8190, Fall 2025)*.
