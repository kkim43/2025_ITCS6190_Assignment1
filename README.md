## PDF Report
[ðŸ“„ Report.pdf](./Report.pdf)

## What the stack does
This project runs two Docker containers: a PostgreSQL database with sample trip data and a Python app. The app reads from the database, calculates basic trip statistics, and saves the results to the console and to out/summary.json.

## Exact commands to run/stop
``` bash
# Build and start 
$ make all

# Start whole process 
$ make up

# Stop whole process and remove volumes
$ make down
```

## Example output (copy/paste)
``` bash

$ make down

docker compose down -v

## Where outputs are written
Outputs are shown both in the process logs in terminal and in the file /out/summary.json.


## Troubleshooting
DB connection information only exists in the local .env file. If the repository is cloned, make sure to create a .env file and fill it with values like the example below:
``` env
POSTGRES_USER="   "
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="    " 
POSTGRES_DB="     "
```
